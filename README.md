# CSC105_PhoneBook

A simple project based on data structures[stack and queue] and file handling that allows the basic functions :
- add new contact
- delete the contact
- search for a contact
- edit the contact
- display the contact list
- recent call log
- import/export contact   
- merge duplicate contact
- add a contact to fav list
just like our real time contact application used on our mobile phones..
